  We analyse this with the hope to learn the patterning genes that are responsible fot the patterning in Forebrain.
  Midbrain and Hindbrain. We start from the analyis RadialGlia Lineage. 
  TO CHANGE 
  To do analyses to add -> when it becomes available we should train a classifier on the clusters at this level.
